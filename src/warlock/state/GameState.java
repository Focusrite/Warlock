/**
 * File: warlock.state.GameState.java
 *
 * An abstract class representing the state the game currently is in.
 *
 * This class implements a singleton pattern to keep track of the active state as there can only be
 * one state active at a time, the class's static instance. Changing state is done by changing the
 * instance to a subclass of GameState.
 *
 * These states can currently be one of the following:
 *  - MenuState  : The first menu
 *  - LobbyState : The pre-game state menu where the playerslots are assigned and settings changed.
 *  - PlayState  : The state where the actual game occurs. Owns a game that handles the gameplay
 *                 aspects.
 *
 * This class provides the main "frame" of methods that cascades down the hierarchy. Many of the lower
 * "ranked" classes delegates these functions (not true delegation as they are not instances of,
 * GameState bar from other states, but methods with same name). These methods of the active state
 * are ran in the main file once per frame, and passes parameters always relevant to their purpose.
 * These methods are:
 *  - update(dt)      : A method for updating things, a double is sent with with the delta time from
 *                      last call to this method.
 *  - render(Graphic) : A method for drawing things on the screen. Passes a Graphic object to allow
 *                      drawing onto the screen.
 *  - handleInput(..) : A method for handling input. Passes an InputHandler for checking keyboard and
 *                      mouse related things.
